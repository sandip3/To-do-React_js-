# 📝 React To-Do App  

A simple yet powerful **To-Do application** built using **ReactJS**.  
This project helped me understand key React concepts like **state management**, **two-way binding**, **conditional rendering**, and **component structuring** — all while building something practical and fun!  

Currently, I'm working on **deploying it via GitHub Pages**, so only the source code is available for now. 🚧

## ⚙️ Features  
- ➕ **Add Tasks** – dynamically add new tasks using component state  
- 👀 **View All Tasks** – display tasks in a clean, structured UI  
- ❌ **Delete Tasks** – remove tasks instantly with state updates  
- ✅ **Mark as Complete / Incomplete** – toggle task status easily  
- 🎨 **Styled with BEM & Tailwind CSS** – clean, modular, and responsive design  

---

## 🧠 Tech Stack  
- **ReactJS**  
- **CSS (BEM + Tailwind Integration)**  
- **Nano ID** – for generating unique task IDs  

---

## 🚀 Future Plans  
- Host the project live via **GitHub Pages**  
- Add **Edit Task** functionality  
- Implement **Local Storage** to persist tasks  
- Add a **Filter (All / Completed / Pending)** view
